## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday, October 28 @3pm
 * Where: PT266, UofT

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
 #### Division into `frontend` and `backend` sub-teams
 It was a great decision to divide our team into `frontend` and `backend` sub-teams, 
 each of which had their meetings and work planning separately 
 (in addition to weekly team meetings and weekly meetings with the partner). 
 This allowed us to share responsibilities efficiently and develop the frontend and backend in parallel. 
 
 Working in sub-teams helped us to concentrate on our own part of work 
 and discuss backend / frontend implementation in more details during sub-team meetings, 
 rather than if we did it during a general team meeting. 
 
 Also, this division created a bigger sense of ownership because each sub-team was solely responsible for their part.    

 #### Drafting API documentation before implementing API
 Before implementing API we drafted its documentation to agree on how the frontend and backend will communicate.
 This was a good decision because it allowed frontend and backend developers to not be dependent on each other:
 once we agreed on the API abstraction, each sub-team could develop their part on their own 
 without being blocked by another sub-team.
 
 In addition, drafting the API documentation before developing the API helped to clarify requirements with the partner.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 #### Not following on our plan to do daily stand up meetings
 Although we planned to have daily 15-minute stand up meetings once we start developing,
 in the reality we did not follow through with this plan due to the lack of time. 
 
 The decision to skip daily stand up meetings results in developers forgetting about their personal deadlines 
 without an additional reminder at a stand up meeting.

#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
